This ends my participation, I had never used databases or built backend applications before, so I am surprised to have come this far.

The executable file escapes my knowledge of how to do it, and I already ran out of time to investigate, the same with the README.
Seeing that I managed to do the backend and the database, I surely would have arrived with more time. Although with the backend and the database working out of 10 together with the frontend, I already went further than expected.

#### Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to try to pass this exam, it was fun to learn how to do these things, it will open the door for me to continue learning how to do this.

## Now the important thing:

- For the database, I used PostgreSQL 16 and pgAdmin 4.
- For the Frontend, I used React JS (^18.3.1) + Vite and Node.js (v20.16.0). Libraries: Axios (^1.7.3), React Dom (^18.3.1), React Router Dom (^6.26.0).
- For the Backend I used Spring Boot (v3.3.2) and Java (jdk-21). [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/;): Maven, Spring Web, Java 21, Packaging Jar, Lombok, Spring Data JPA and PostgreSQL Driver.
- npm (v10.8.2).
- IDE: I used VS Code with the extensions "Extension Pack for Java" (by microsoft.com), "ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets" (by dsznajder), "Extension Pack for Java Auto Config" (by Pleiades), "Java" (by Oracle Corporation) and "Java Language Support" (by George Fraser).
